## üì± Scoppy Application Overview

**Scoppy** is an oscilloscope and logic analyzer app that works with your Android device and Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico W).

- **How it works:** 
  - Signals are measured by the Raspberry Pi Pico.
  - Waveforms are displayed in real time on your Android phone or tablet via the Scoppy app.
- **No programming required:** Both the app and firmware are freely available.
- **Easy installation:** Setup takes only a few minutes.

### üì° Pico W Advantage
The **Pico W** (Wi-Fi enabled version) lets you use Scoppy **wirelessly**, eliminating the need for a physical USB connection between the Pico and your smartphone.
